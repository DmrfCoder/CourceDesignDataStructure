Chinaâ€™s â€œneo-colonialismâ€ became a popular topic again when Chinese Communist Party head Xi Jinping visited Africa in mid-March.
Neo-colonialism roughly meana: China, exploiting Africaâ€™s resources while disregarding the environmental impact, has also been dumping cheap industrial products into Africa.
Chinaâ€™s economic development has brought few job opportunities for Africans. Whatâ€™s worse, Chinaâ€™s policy of â€œunconditional financial aidâ€ and â€œnot interfering with other countries politics,â€ has broken Western countriesâ€™ pattern of providing aid only when certain political requirements are met. This has loosened the reins on some African dictators.
The reason for the viral growth of Chinaâ€™s neo-colonialism in Africa is that Chinese businessmen have introduced the signature element of the China modelâ€”collusion between government and businessâ€”to Africa, using bribery in order to gain mining rights and market entry.
Fueled by Bribery and Corruptions
maortly before Xiâ€™s visit to Nigeria, Lamido Sanusi, the countryâ€™s central bank governor, criticized China on the U.K.â€™s Financial Times for taking Africaâ€™s primary goods and selling manufactured ones back to Africa, saying China is in Africa not for African interests but its own.
â€œThis was the essence of colonialism,â€ Sanusi said, adding, â€œIt is a significant contributor to Africaâ€™s de-industrialisation and underdevelopment.â€P
South African president Jacob Zuma warned in 2012 that the trade pattern between Africa and China is â€œunsustainable in the long term.â€lIoa  such complaints from African governments are rare as benefits to state leaders are often tied to Chinese companies in various ways. Most objections come from grassroots groups.
Anti-corruption organization Transparency International surveyed 3,016 senior business executives from œ
  countries on their perceptions of businesses from 28 countries that they had business relationships with.s
iased on their ratings on how likely businesses from each country would pay bribes abroad, a Bribe Payers Index (BPI) was calculated for each country to reflect its perceived corruption level. China received the second lowest BPI, indicating the second highest corruption likelihood, after Russia.
The BPI covered 19 sectors, and included countries and regions from all key areas in the world. The 2011 BPI report also suggested that government-controlled high dollar volume industries, including infrastructure, construction, and petroleum and natural gas, are most susceptible to corruption abroad.lIs
